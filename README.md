# reflectr

CLI tool to mirror photos, albums, tags, descriptions, etc for a Flickr account.

## Install

```
npm install -g reflectr
```

## Usage

First create an application at [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/) to generate an API key and secret.

Then create a folder to store the mirrored data and run the following command in that folder.

```
reflectr
```

You will then be prompted for a passphrase to store encrypted Flickr secrets, your Flickr API key and secret, and to authorize that API key for your account.
